    <p>Memory works in the brain much like the rest of the brain works. In a very malleable way. Memory isn't the same forever, it's constantly changing, everytime we remember it.</p>

<p>When it comes to memory, most people think of it in terms of a filing system, where a memory is archived in a single place, remaining like a book on a shelf, until desired. However, this is not the case our brain is made up of numerous sections that perform specific roles, which our brain then utilizes to save the memory. â€‹For example:
  <ul>
    <li> Whenever an experience is being acquired, the brain must stabilize the memory by bringing it to a temporary transit point in our brain, called the hippocampus.</li>
<li>Once the memory arrives in the hippocampus, the elements of our experiences are then broken down into neurons and assigned housing according to their function, as fragments of our memory.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
  </section>

    <p>To illustrate, the visual portion of the memory is stored in the visual cortex of the brain, in the form of a neuron, and so on and so forth.
      <ul>
        <li>As a result of this intuitive process, when a memory is recalled, it will then occur in the same pattern that created the initial event. </li>
        <li>ss, when a memory is recalled, it will then occur in the same pattern that created the initial event. For this reason, according to our senses, we remember experiences just as they happened.</li>
        <li>Consequently, when you recall a memory, you are exposing it to the variables of the circumstance in which you recall it, leaving the initial memory susceptible to alteration.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Given these points, we can now better grasp the position of a person who suffers from a trauma-borne mental illness such as, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.</p>
    <p> In view of this knowledge, mental health professionals are afforded better resources in developmental forms of therapy, using our natural processing to associate the negative memory with positive scenarios, in hopes of abating the original memory.</p>

    <p>Here is an example of your brain creating a memory:</p>
      <p><pre><code>perception ---> sensory memory ----> attention ---> working memory ---> elaborative encoding ----> long-term memory</code></pre></p>

    <p>The hippocampus plays a huge role in the retrival of your memories.</p>
    
    <p>Where am I? (says, Mx. Hippocampus.)
    <pre><code>The hippocampus belongs to the limbic system.</code></pre>
   The hippocampus has a unique shape, similar to that of a horseshoe.</p>
<p> We would not even be able to remember where our house is without the work of the hippocampus.
<pre><code> it is located (your hippocampus, not your house, silly. But I guess in theory your house is located there, cause you couldn't find your house without it.) in the region that regulates emotions. </code></pre>

    <p>The effects of stress cause a big issue that interfers with encoding memory.</p>
    <>One of the reasons for that is during times of stress your body responds to the stress by releasing stress hormones.
    <pre><code> Stress ---> Cortisol releasing into blood ---> Over-secretion ---> damage to long-term memory/recall ability.
</code></pre></p>

<p> Interesting enough, even though long-term memory is impacted by stress in a negative way. The opposite is true for short-term memory, this is true especially for emotional memory.
  <pre><code> Stress ----> Over-secretion  ---> Enhanced short-term memory ---> Emotionally Reactive
</code></pre>
